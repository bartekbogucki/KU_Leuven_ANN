Developed and trained deep learning models using Python and TensorFlow/Keras. Implemented feedforward, convolutional, recurrent, and transformer architectures for tasks in classification, sequence modeling. Explored generative models including autoencoders and GANs. Applied best practices such as regularization, optimization tuning, and performance evaluation to improve training stability and generalization.
